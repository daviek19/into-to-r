##Payroll is the name of the data set that will consist the number of items on the frame
Payroll<-data.frame(Name,County,Gender,Salary)
Payroll
##To find out the number of rows and columns on the dataset using the function nrow(dataname)
nrow(Payroll)
ncol(Payroll)
##To get the names of the dataset
names(Payroll)
##Finding out what seq does
?seq
###Seq(From,to,by)
##Using head
head(Payroll,n=5)
##Usinf tail
tail(Payroll,n=-5)
tail(Payroll,n=5)
tail(Payroll,n=9)
tail(Payroll,n=-9)
##Using indexing in a dataframe using the formula df[i,j] i is the row and j is the column
Payroll[8,2]
a<-Payroll[14,2]
a
##Extracting county column from payroll using the $ sign
which(Payroll$County=="Nyeri")
df[Payroll]

#class practice exercise - based on Wednesday March 20th class
#creating a dataframe - a dataframe is single table with rows and columns - you did this in class. Please use this exercise for practice.
#note R is case sensitive
#dataframes provide a spreadsheet like look. when analyzing data in R after loading, its much easier with the help of a dataframe structure, it is very ideal with structured data.
#here we start by creating individual vectors, which we then combine to make a dataframe
product <- c("bag", "shoes","belt","belt")
total_price <- c(500, 1000,150,200)
color <- c("blue","red","red","blue")
quantity <- c(5,2,3,4)
productdetails <- data.frame(product, total_price, color, quantity) #creates a dataframe based on the vectors created - that we specify
class(productdetails)
productdetails[,2] #this extracts the second column
product <- c("bag", "shoes","belt","belt")
total_price <- c(500, 1000,150,200)
color <- c("blue","red","red","blue")
quantity <- c(5,2,3,4)
productdetails <- data.frame(product, total_price, color, quantity) #creates a dataframe based on the vectors created - that we specify
productdetails <- data.frame(product, total_price, color, quantity) #creates a dataframe based on the vectors created - that we specify
productdetails
plot(productdetails)
plot(productdetails %>%  select(product,total_price))
library(dplyr)
plot(productdetails %>%  select(product,total_price))
library(dplyr)
productdetails
plot(productdetails %>%  select(product,total_price))
